The usual way to include LaTeX is to use `$$`, as shown in the examples below.

These examples are taken from <http://khan.github.io/KaTeX/>

### Example 1
If the text between `$$` contains newlines it will rendered in display mode:
```
$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$
```

$$
f(x) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty\hat f(\xi)\,e^{2 \pi i \xi x}\,d\xi
$$
