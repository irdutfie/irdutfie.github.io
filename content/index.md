# hello

Hi I'm Ian.

Some things about me that I do when going about my work:
- Lead the charge to build and maintain key business platforms
- Change the culture
- Improve the service
- Challenge the established way of work
  
  

  
## Skills

C#, .NET, HTML, CSS, GitHub, VS Code, React, Xamarin, Blazor, SQL, LINQ, Azure, AWS, Kubernetes.

Learning Rust by using zola (used for his site) and coding beyond this...

`println!("inline code");`

```rs
fn main(n: String) {
    println!("hello, zola!");
}
```

### Education

> I love a challenge and like working on  
> big complex problems that involve people,
> technology and even politics.

##### A little about this template
  
Like zerm? Then [install
Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) and
[get started](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/#installing-a-theme)!

[^1]: fork? port? a little bit of the former, more of the latter?
