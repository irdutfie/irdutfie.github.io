# hello

Hi I'm Ian.

WHere are some things about me:
- I love a challenge and like working on big complex problems that involve people, technology and even politics.
  
  

  
## Skills

`println!("inline code");`

```rs
fn main(n: String) {
    println!("hello, zola!");
}
```

### Education

##### A little about this template
  
Like zerm? Then [install
Zola](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/getting-started/installation/) and
[get started](https://www.getzola.org/documentation/themes/installing-and-using-themes/#installing-a-theme)!
